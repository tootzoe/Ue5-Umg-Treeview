# Ue5-Umg-Treeview

tree view in UMG , unreal engine , is made of c++ , lots of components made of c++ have same concepts , so i understand it a bit of easy because i am a c/c++ programer . i found lots documents (videos) online about treeview didn't talk about the working principle of tree view, so i made this video to share my knowledge about tree view , hope you like it ~~

know issues:
 the bllueprint file utils plugin, only has "find files" that dosen't scan sub-folder recursive, no have "find folder" , 
 "find files" is recursive,  so when scan a folder with large sub-folders , app will crash.

 so you have to implement your "find folders" in c++.

 i just want to keep sameple simple, i don't add c++ relevance yet....
